    <h4>What exactly is this?</h4>
    <p>A group of people at BuzzFeed who want to learn more about statistics.</p>

    <h4>How long will this group be in existence?</h4>
    <p>For now, about 10-12 weeks. Our first official meeting (i.e. where we do actual statistics) begins on Monday, June 15.</p>

    <h4>What’s the format of the group?</h4>
    <p>Each meeting will comprise of two halves: the first half hour will be devoted to going through the assigned problems; the second half hour will be devoted to covering new material for the next topic.</p>

    <h4>Wait so there are take-home assignments??</h4>
    <p>Yes! But don’t worry! They will be purposely designed to take only an hour or two of your time. Also, the goal is try to understand what’s going on - so there’s no pressure to finish everything or get the right answer. The main thing is that you actually, genuinely, attempt the assignment.</p>

    <h4>How much statistics do we need to know upfront?</h4>
    <p>None. Though this requirement will change as we get further and further into the year. If you don’t know any statistics at all, it’s best that you start in the beginning - or reach out to Anita for ways to catch up.</p>

    <h4>Are we using a book? Which one?</h4>
    <p>Yes. We will be using a few different books for this class. See the list under "Resources" on the homepage.</p>

    <h4>I heard there were feedback surveys...</h4>
    <p>Yes, a feedback survey will be sent out immediately after each class. You will need to fill this out in order to make sure the class stays relevant to you.</p>

    <h4>Wait so how was this format decided on?</h4>
    <p>The group present at our first meeting (Logistics) brainstormed this layout for the class. Obviously, we will change it if the model no longer fits what people are looking for (this, after all, is the point of the surveys).</p>

    <h4>What if I’m remote?</h4>
    <p>Slack Anita. She’ll send you an invite to the google hangouts for that class.</p>

    <h4>Can I bring my laptop?</h4>
    <p>Nope. Just a pencil or two, your notebook/assignment/book etc and your brain. I’ll let you know if you need your computer!</p>

    <h4>Will there be snacks provided, specifically cupcakes?</h4>
    <p>Probably, because fun.</p>
